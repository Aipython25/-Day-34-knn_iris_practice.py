# KNN Classifier – Iris Dataset (Practice Project)

This project is a simple implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using the famous **Iris dataset**.

It's designed for practice purposes, to understand how KNN works in classification tasks.

---

## 🔍 What’s Covered

1. **Basic Classification (K = 3):**  
   Load the Iris dataset, split it into training and testing, train the model, and print the accuracy.

2. **Practice 1 – Accuracy for Different K Values:**  
   Check how accuracy changes when K goes from 1 to 10.

3. **Practice 2 – Predicting a New Flower:**  
   Test the model on a new sample flower to predict its species.

4. **Practice 3 – Confusion Matrix Visualization:**  
   Plot a confusion matrix using seaborn to understand how well the model performed.
